### EPA in-situ PM2.5 data downloading
Historical EPA PM2.5 data downloading using <code>EPA_pm_down.py</code>. Set up the time duration. The outputs are monthly dataframes with hourly data.

### MINTS's data downloading
Historical MINTS data from all the Nodes can be downloaded using <code>/MINTS_scripts/pythonSyncher.py</code>. This required <code>mintsDefinitionsBirdCall.yaml</code> file to be in the same directory (which not included). The outputs are daily CSV files 10 seconds temporal fequency.

### OpenAQ PM2.5, Meteorological data, AOD data downloading.
Historical OpenAQ PM2.5 data, meteorological data with humidity data and AOD data can be downloaded using <code>meteo_AOD_openAQ_down.py</code>. The outputs are hourly CSV files.

### Averaging MINTSâ€™s PM2.5 data hourly and combine with EPA and OpenAQ PM2.5 data.
The python script <code>pm_clean.py</code> will average the PM2.5 data from MINTS sensors and the combine those hourly data with EPA and OpenAQ PM2.5 data. The outputs are monthly CSV files of PM2.5 data from all the sources.

### Finding all the in-situ locations
Combine all the monthly CSV of PM2.5 data together and find all the PM ground observation locations using <code>findPM_sensorCoord.py</code>. The output is a CSV with all the ground sensors locations.

### Matching ancillary data (without building footprint) with sensor locations.
Pre-required ground sensor location CSV file from the previous step. Match the ancillary data with sensor coordiantes using <code>ancillary_data_match.py</code>. The output is a CSV file of sensor location with ancillary data (without building footprint data).
